---------------- Your solution to Lab 3 ----------------

-- Include here any code you need from your solution to Lab 3 for testing
-- purposes. After a few days, I will release my solution for you to use.
-- Don't duplicate the code just given above.



---------------- Part 1 ----------------

-- Implement the seven recursive predicates/operations on RegExp given in
-- Section 3.3 of the notes; call them empty, unitary, byp, inf, rever, lq,
-- and nep. Each should begin with a type declaration. Include several tests
-- for each function.

-- empty is given in lecture
-- unitary covered
-- bypass covered
-- rever covered a little
--



---------------- Part 2 ----------------

-- Implement the two matching algorithms given in Section 3.4 of the notes,
-- where the second algorithm is the modified one I posted on Piazza (@96).
-- Call them match1 and match2. Start by implementing splits:

-- splits xs = list of all possible splits of xs, in order. For example,
-- splits "abc" = [("","abc"), ("a","bc"), ("ab","c"), ("abc","")]
splits :: [a] -> [([a], [a])]
splits xs = undefined
--covered


match1 :: RegExp -> String -> Bool
match1 r w = undefined
--covered

match2 :: RegExp -> String -> Bool
match2 r w = undefined



-- Some regular expressions for testing. Also, test them on other solutions
-- to the exercises of Section 3.2 (as many as you can get).

sigma = ['a', 'b']                -- Alphabet used in all examples below

ab   = toRE "aa.bb.+*"            -- every letter is duplicated
ttla = toRE "ab+*a.ab+.ab+."      -- third to last letter is a
ena  = toRE "b*a.b*.a.*b*."       -- even number of a's
bb1  = toRE "aba.+*b.b.aab.+*."   -- contains bb exactly once


-- For your tests, you may also find the following helpful. For example,
-- you can generate all strings of length 10 (or 20) or less and then test
-- to see whether match1 r w == memb (lol w) (lang_of r) for each such w.

-- All strings on sigma of length <= n (useful for testing)
strings :: Int -> [String]
strings n = concat $ [replicateM i sigma | i <- [0..n]]
